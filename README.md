## Intensity Calculations

Program calculates the intensity of light from a quantum optics system.
You must input the system's prepare and project polarization states (V, H, D, A, R, L).
It uses the 'sympy' package to calculate the Jones matrix operation (derived from Malus' law) and details of your quantum optics systems.
