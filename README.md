## Quantum Optics Projects for the SQO group

The following program files are used for quantum optics simulations, calculations and data analysis.
These programs are used for research projects in the Structural Quantum Optics group at the University of Ottawa (https://sqogroup.ca/).

`intensity.py`:
This program file calculates the intensity of light from a quantum optics system.
You must input the system's prepare and project polarization states (V, H, D, A, R, L).
It uses the 'sympy' package to calculate the Jones matrix operation and details of your quantum optics systems.
