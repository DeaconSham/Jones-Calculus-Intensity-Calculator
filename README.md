intensity.py:
This program file is used to calculate the intensity of light from a quantum optics system.
You must input the system's prepare and project polarization states (V, H, D, A, R, L).
The program uses the 'sympy' package to calculate the Jones matrix operation along with details of your quantum optics systems.
